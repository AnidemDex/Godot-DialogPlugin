### Changed
- **Timeline editor view.**
- **Main screen behaviour.** The editor now instances itself only when you select the editor, and free itself if you change the main screen. Keeping free RAM is never easy.

### Fixed
- [Leaked instances on exit.](https://github.com/AnidemDex/Godot-DialogPlugin/issues/1)
