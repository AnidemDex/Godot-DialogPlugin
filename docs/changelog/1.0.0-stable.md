# \[1.0.0] Stable

This is the first stable release. To manage to release this, many things were removed to add them later on 1.x versions (like, the timelines).

### Added:

* **`DialogNode` node class**
* **`DialogBubble` node class**
* **`PortraitManager` node class**
* **`DialogManager` node class**
* **`OptionManager` node class**
* **`Portrait` resource class**
* **`Character` resource class**
* **DialogNode customization through themes**

### Removed:

* **Literally everything from `dialog_plugin` folder**. Take a look on previous pre-release versions to see what exactly were removed. Those features will be reimplemented in future minor versions.
