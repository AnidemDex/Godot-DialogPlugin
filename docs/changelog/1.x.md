# \[1.x] Stable

## \[1.1] Unreleased

### Added:
* **Reference hint in PortraitManager.** Now the reference rect node that were used previously is built-in directly on the node, letting you modify it directly in PortraitManager.

### Fixed:
* **`DialogNode` doesn't emmit signals `option_selected` and `option_added`.** Now is fixed by [864ba49](https://github.com/AnidemDex/Godot-DialogPlugin/pull/59)
* **Options are removed if they are added while OptionsManager emmits `option_selected` signal.** Fixed by [37ed82b](https://github.com/AnidemDex/Godot-DialogPlugin/pull/58)

### Removed:
* **ReferenceRect node from PortraitManager.**

## \[1.0] 2021-11-21
This is the first stable release. To manage to release this, many things were removed to add them later on 1.x versions (like, the timelines).

### Added:

* **`DialogNode` node class**
* **`DialogBubble` node class**
* **`PortraitManager` node class**
* **`DialogManager` node class**
* **`OptionManager` node class**
* **`Portrait` resource class**
* **`Character` resource class**
* **DialogNode customization through themes**

### Removed:

* **Literally everything from `dialog_plugin` folder**. Take a look on previous pre-release versions to see what exactly were removed. Those features will be reimplemented in future minor versions.
