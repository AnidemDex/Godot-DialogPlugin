# \[1.x] Stable

## \[1.1] Unreleased

### Added:
* **Reference hint in PortraitManager.** Now the reference rect node that were used previously is built-in directly on the node, letting you modify it directly in PortraitManager.
* **Integration with EventSystem.** Use Textalog not only as a Dialog Node, but as a Dialog System too [#56](https://github.com/AnidemDex/Godot-DialogPlugin/pull/56).

### Changed:
* **`DialogManager.text_autoscroll` will be false by default.**
* **`DialogManager.text_fit_content_height` will be false by default.**

### Fixed:
* **Fix an issue related to showing DialogNode on show_text() call**. Because somebody forgots to shows the node in a `show` function. [#53](https://github.com/AnidemDex/Godot-DialogPlugin/pull/53)
* **`DialogNode` doesn't emmit signals `option_selected` and `option_added`.** Now is fixed by [864ba49](https://github.com/AnidemDex/Godot-DialogPlugin/pull/59)
* **Options are removed if they are added while OptionsManager emmits `option_selected` signal.** Fixed by [37ed82b](https://github.com/AnidemDex/Godot-DialogPlugin/pull/58)
* **An error related to autoscroll feature.** No more `get_wordwrap_string_size: Condition "p_width <= 0" is true. Returned: Vector2(0, get_height())` annoying error the first time you try the plugin. [#64](https://github.com/AnidemDex/Godot-DialogPlugin/pull/64)

### Removed:
* **ReferenceRect node from PortraitManager.**

## \[1.0] 2021-11-21

* **`PortraitManager` node class**
* **`DialogManager` node class**
* **`OptionManager` node class**
* **`Portrait` resource class**
* **`Character` resource class**
