# Installation

Download the lastest release and extract the ZIP file. Move the `addons` folders to the root of your project. Finally, enable the plugin in your project settings, under `plugins` tab. It's that easy!

> You can take a look in a more detailed tutorial in the [plugin's documentation](https://godotplugins.gitbook.io/textalog/getting-started/installation).

If you want more information about installing plugins in Godot, please refer to [official documentation page](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/plugins/editor/installing\_plugins.html).

If you're downloading the repository instead, make sure to move only `textalog` to your `addons` folder. Extra files and folders are for debug purposes.
