### üê±‚Äçüë§ Characters and üñºÔ∏è Portraits
Characters are data containers to describe what expressions (portraits) are going to be used in dialogue and what properties of the dialogue will be overriden during the gameplay.

### üé® Customization through Godot's Themes
Modify the DialogNode through themes!

### Use it as a Dialog System!
The plugin can help you creating sequences of dialogs and dialog branches to certain conditions, all in the editor, thanks to its integration with [EventSystem](https://github.com/AnidemDex/Godot-EventSystem).

You can create the entire dialog sequence through code too!

See more about this implementation on [the documentation](#).

## üö© Installation

Download the lastest release and extract the ZIP file. Move the `addons` folders to the root of your project. Finally, enable the plugin in your project settings, under `plugins` tab. It's that easy!

> You can take a look in a more detailed tutorial in the [plugin's documentation](https://godotplugins.gitbook.io/textalog/getting-started/installation).
If you want more information about installing plugins in Godot, please refer to [official documentation page](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/plugins/editor/installing_plugins.html).

If you're downloading the repository instead, make sure to move only `textalog` to your `addons` folder. Extra files and folders are for debug purposes.

## üßµ Usage
Quick example to try the most simple functionality: showing text on the screen.
```gdscript
extends Node

func _ready() -> void:
  # Creates a new DialogNode instance
  var dialog_node = DialogNode.instance()
  # Add the node as child
  add_child(dialog_node)

  # Show an string. BBCode works too!
  dialog_node.show_text("Hello world!")
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è `Control` node and `Node2D` node types are incompatible. If you want to add the `DialogNode` as child of a Node2D type, make sure to give it a proper `rect_size`, add it as child of a `CanvasLayer` or add it in the scene, not in code.



## üîé What is new on this version? [1.1]

Second release! Who would think about it?
The most relevant about this update is its reintegration with EventSystem, to use it as a Dialog System again! üéâ

* Added:
  * **Reference hint in PortraitManager.** Now the reference rect node that were used previously is built-in directly on the node, letting you modify it directly in PortraitManager.
  * **Integration with EventSystem.** Use Textalog not only as a Dialog Node, but as a Dialog System too [#56](https://github.com/AnidemDex/Godot-DialogPlugin/pull/56).
* Changed:
  * **`DialogManager.text_autoscroll` will be false by default.**
  * **`DialogManager.text_fit_content_height` will be false by default.**
* Removed:
  * **ReferenceRect node from PortraitManager.**
