## ⚠Warning⚠

> This plugin is **not** ready for use, yet. 

You can try it anyway, but be sure to make a copy of your dialog files. The format will not change, but, just in case.

# Installation

Download the lastest release and extract the ZIP file. Move the `addons` folders to the root of your project. It's that easy!

If you want more information about installing plugins in Godot, please refer to [official documentation page](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/plugins/editor/installing_plugins.html).

If you're downloading the repository instead, make sure to move only `dialog_plugin` to your `addons` folder. Extra folders are for debug purposes.

# What is new on this version? [0.3.1]

We are still very excited to release version 1.0 but we will not get carried away and release something that is not debugged.

* Bugfixes:
  * Now you can drag events from buttons (again)
  * Now you can create Characters (again) without being locked out of the tool.
  * Improvements to Drag&Drop
