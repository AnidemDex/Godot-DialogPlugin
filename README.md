## üö© Installation

Download the lastest release and extract the ZIP file. Move the `addons` folders to the root of your project. It's that easy!

> You can take a look in a more detailed tutorial in the [plugin's documentation](https://godotplugins.gitbook.io/textalog/getting-started/installation).

If you want more information about installing plugins in Godot, please refer to [official documentation page](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/plugins/editor/installing_plugins.html).

If you're downloading the repository instead, make sure to move only `textalog` to your `addons` folder. Extra files and folders are for debug purposes.

## üßµ Usage
Quick example to try the most simple functionality: showing text on the screen.
```gdscript
func _ready() -> void:
  # Creates a new DialogNode instance
  var dialog_node = DialogNode.instance()

  # Add the node as child
  add_child(dialog_node)

  # Shows the dialog node
  dialog_node.show()

  # Show an string. BBCode works too!
  dialog_node.show_text("Hello world!")
```

## üîé What is new on this version? [1.0]
