## âš Warningâš 

> This plugin is **not** ready for use, yet. 

You can try it anyway, but be sure to make a copy of your dialog files. The format will not change, but, just in case.

# Installation

Download the lastest release and extract the ZIP file. Move the `addons` folders to the root of your project. It's that easy!

If you want more information about installing plugins in Godot, please refer to [official documentation page](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/plugins/editor/installing_plugins.html).

If you're downloading the repository instead, make sure to move only `dialog_plugin` to you `addons` folder. Extra folders are for debug purposes.

# What is new on this version? [0.1.4]
- **Say "Â¡Hola!" to internationalization.** Now you can use translations in your dialogs, and export or import those _(as .csv)_ aswell. Don't worry, you can use your own translations before using the plugin.

# How to use it

This can be separated as 2 different things:
## Create your timeline

1. First, create a timeline, inside the Dialog Editor tab.
   
   After activating the plugin, go to Dialog Editor tab. It should be next to `AssetLib` tab.

   ![Godot View Tabs](.images/godot_view_tabs.png)

   Then, click on `Timelines` button and `New` button.

   ![New Timeline](.images/godot_new_timeline.png)

2. Add some events to that timeline. A timeline without events will not work, and will halt your game if you try to use it.

> **Note**: you can also can create timelines and events through code if you preffer.

## Instantiate your Dialog node with your timeline

Now you need to create a new `Dialog` node, and `start` it with your recently created timeline.

You had 2 options:
### ðŸ”µ Create it from code:

```gdscript
# ...
# inside any node in the scene
# ...

# Create the node first and start it with your timeline
var dialog_node = Dialog.start(<your_timeline>)

# Add that node to the scene
add_child(dialog_node)
```
`<your_timeline>` can be:

- The name of your timeline (the name that you used when you created it), 
- The absolute path (something like `res://dialog_files/timelines/<your_timeline>.tres`) to that timeline,
- A `DialogTimelineResource`.

### ðŸ”µ Instantiate it in the scene through the editor:
   
![Instance dialog](.images/godot_instance_dialog_node.png)

Then, select the node:

![Dialog Node](.images/godot_scene_tree.png)

And, inside the Inspector tab, select the timeline:

![Inspector](.images/godot_inspector_tab.png)

That's it, it's fair simple.

> For now, there's only 3 events. They'll be more, and you can create your custom events if you want.
