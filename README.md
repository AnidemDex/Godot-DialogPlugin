## âš Warningâš 

> This plugin is **not** ready for use, yet. 

You can try it anyway, but be sure to make a copy of your dialog files. The format will not change, but, just in case.

# Installation

Download the lastest release and extract the ZIP file. Move the `addons` folders to the root of your project. It's that easy!

If you want more information about installing plugins in Godot, please refer to [official documentation page](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/plugins/editor/installing_plugins.html).

# How to use it

That's a good question.

1. First, create a timeline, inside the Dialog Editor tab.
   
   After activating the plugin, go to Dialog Editor tab. It should be next to `AssetLib` tab.

   Then, click on `Timelines` button and `New` button.

2. Add some events to that timeline. A timeline without events will not work, and will halt your game if you try to use it.

3. Create a new `Dialog` node, and `start` it with your recently created timeline.
   
   You had 2 options:
   1. Create it from code:
```gdscript
# ...
# inside any node in the scene
# ...

# Create the node first and start it with your timeline
var dialog_node = Dialog.start(<your_timeline>)

# Add that node to the scene
add_child(dialog_node)
```
`your_timeline` can be the name of your timeline (the name that you used when you created it), the absolute path to that timeline or a `DialogTimelineResource`.

   2. or Instantiate it in the scene editor:
   
![Instance dialog](.images/godot_instance_dialog_node.png)
Then, select the node:

And, inside the Inspector tab, select the timeline:

That's it, it's fair simple.

> For now, there's only 3 events. They'll be more, and you can create your custom events if you want.
